This app is one that can be used for further ideas, such as: 

* Connect to webserver that will provide more questions (PYTHON, ASP.NET, NODE.JS)
* Implement ability of creating quizzes (small server with database)
  * Implement checking functions to see if multiple choice
  * Implement timer for each question
* User accounts and user pannel
  * Show all of the quizzes created by the user
  * Points
